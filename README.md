## Brain stimulation and emotional memory (nd_tms_eeg)

##### Main findings:
* The results demonstrated that, relative to control stimulation, sTBS to the mPFC enhanced memory for negative objects on the long delay test (collapsed across specific and gist-based memory measures). mPFC stimulation had no discernable effect on memory for objects on the short delay test nor on the background images at either test. These results suggest that mPFC activity occurring during encoding interacts with consolidation processes to preferentially preserve negatively salient information .

##### Task overview:
* Each experiment was comprised a study and test phase and which was built in matlab.
* In the study phase, participants were presented with scenes that were created by placing negative (e.g., bear) and neutral objects (e.g., deer) onto plausible neutral backgrounds (e.g., forest). Importantly, participants received stimulation to either the medial prefrontal cortext or and active control site (motor cortex). 
* Participants completed a recognition test after a short delay (30 minutes) and following a long sleep filled delay (24 hours). The recognition test consisted of old scenes presented during the encoding task were decomposed into their objects and backgrounds and presented individually intermixed with new (lure/foil) objects and backgrounds.    <p align = "center"> <img src="https://github.com/nickwyeh/nd_tms_eeg/blob/main/figures/methods_figure.png"  width="800"> </p>
