## Brain stimulation and emotional memory (nd_tms_eeg)

##### Main findings:
* The results demonstrated that, relative to control stimulation, short theta burst stimulation to the medial prefrontal cortex enhanced memory for negative objects on the long delay test (collapsed across specific and gist-based memory measures). Medial prefrontal cortex stimulation had no discernable effect on memory for objects on the short delay test nor on the background images at either test. These results suggest that mPFC activity occurring during encoding interacts with consolidation processes to preferentially preserve negatively salient information.

##### Task overview:
* The experiment was comprised two sessions, a emotional study task (TMS-EEG) and recognition memory task.
* During the study task, participants were presented with scenes that were created by placing negative (e.g., bear) and neutral objects (e.g., deer) onto plausible neutral backgrounds (e.g., forest). Importantly, participants received stimulation to either the medial prefrontal cortext or an active control site (motor cortex). The stimulation occured interwoven inbetween encoding blocks. For example, following each blokc (6 trials of 3 negative and 3 neutral scenes) participants were told to close their eyes and relax while stimulation was applied. 
* Participants completed a recognition test after a short delay (30 minutes) and following a long sleep filled delay (24 hours). The recognition test consisted of the old scenes presented during the encoding task that were decomposed into "same" objects/backgrounds, "similar" objects/backgrounds and completely "new" objects/backgrounds. The scene components were always presented indvidually and randomly intermixed.    <p align = "center"> <img src="https://github.com/nickwyeh/nd_tms_eeg/blob/main/figures/methods_figure.png"  width="800"> </p>
